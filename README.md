# About me


**ZheShuenLee/ZheShuenLee** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on neutrinos/ spectroscopy project 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning particle physics/ stellar atmospheres.
I need to highlight these: ==I am a beginner==.
